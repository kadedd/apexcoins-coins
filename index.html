We employ other businesses and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include fulfilling orders, site analysis, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance and providing customer service. They may have access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions.<br>
<br><br>
<span style="text-align: justify; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Aggregate Information</span><br>
<br>
We may share aggregate information, such as demographics and site usage statistics, with advertisers, sponsors or other organizations. When this type of information is shared, the other parties do not have access to your personally identifiable information.<br>
<br><br>
<span style="text-align: justify; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Third Party Offers</span><br>

We never sell your information, but we may occasionally send communications from valued Appventure Studio’s partners.

<br>
We may use a third-party network advertiser to serve the advertisements on the Service or may use a traffic measurement service to analyze the traffic on the Service. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to this site and other websites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products or websites in which you might have an interest. Audience and traffic measurement services allow us to collect anonymous traffic and behavior information by monitoring anonymous visitor activity. Such advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their cookies on your computer if you choose to have cookies enabled. Other companies’ uses of their cookies are subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.<br>
<br><br>
<span style="text-align: justify; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Business Transfers</span><br>

In the event that our assets are sold or transferred to another party, or another transaction occurs in which your personally identifiable information is one of the business assets transferred, all personally identifiable information that has been collected and saved may be one of the business assets we transfer. <br>
<br><br>
<span style="text-align: justify; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Legal Process and Compliance with Laws and Policies</span><br>
<br>
We or others may disclose your personal information and any other information collected by the Service to law enforcement agencies and other third parties without notice to you in order to comply with applicable law, to investigate suspected fraud, harassment or other violations of applicable law or of our Service policies, to protect our or third parties’ rights, or to protect the rights of other visitors.<br>
<br><br>
<span style="text-align: justify; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">When You Consent</span><br>
<br>
Other than as described above, if your information might go to third parties, you will have an opportunity to choose not to share your information.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 24px;text-align: justify; font-weight: 600;">OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span><br>
<br>
<span style="text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;font-weight: 800;">Security</span><br>
<br>
The Service incorporates reasonable safeguards to protect the security, integrity, completeness, accuracy and privacy of the personal information that we may collect. We have put into place reasonable precautions to protect such information from loss, misuse and alteration, but we cannot guarantee that information collected by the Service will be free from unauthorized access. Our security policies are reviewed periodically and revised as required.<br>
<br><br>
<span style="text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;font-weight: 800;">Links to Other Websites</span><br>
<br>
You should be aware that when you use the Service, you could be directed to other websites beyond our control. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and marketing partners, and these third parties may use our logos as part of a sponsorship agreement. These other websites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. If you visit a website that is linked to the Service, you should consult that website’s privacy policy before providing any personal information. We do not have any control over third party websites and are not liable to you for any claims that may arise from your use of third party websites.<br>
<br><br>
<span style="text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;font-weight: 800;">Information You Make Public</span><br>
<br>
The Service, including mobile applications and pages we make available through social networking sites such as Instagram and Facebook, may have features that allow you to post information that can be viewed by other visitors, such as commenting, chat rooms, forums and message boards. You are not required to provide any personal information when using these features but you may choose to do so. If you post personal information online, it will be publicly available and you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. In addition, when you post a comment to a mobile application, the user name with which you registered for the Service and your current location may be made publicly available on the Service and through the mobile application. We cannot ensure the security of any information you choose to make public using these features, and it may remain available indefinitely. Also, we cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in these areas.<br>
<br><br>
<span style="text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;font-weight: 800;">Data Retention</span><br>
<br>
We will retain your information for as long as needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. If you wish to request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, contact us at contact.kadashi@gmail.com. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. We store information about visitors on servers located in Mexico and the United States, but we may also store such information on servers and equipment in other countries. If you wish to have your information deleted from the Service, we will attempt to do so if we are not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes. We reserve the right to decline requests that are impractical or require an unreasonable level of technical effort.<br>
<br><br>
<span style="text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;font-weight: 800;">Our Policies Concerning Children and minors</span><br>
<br>
Our Service is not intended for children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. In the event that we learn that we have inadvertently gathered personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will take reasonable measures to promptly erase such information from our records.<br>
<br>
We do however collect personally identifiable information and medias from minors with the age of 13 years or older, but when we do, we always ask for the approval and authorization of their parents and/or legal guardians. In the event that we learn that we have inadvertently gathered personal information from a minor with the age of 13 years or older without the authorization of their parents and/or legal guardians, we will take reasonable measures to promptly erase such information from our records.<br>
<br><br>
<span style="text-align: justify; font-size: 20px;font-weight: 800;">Changes to this Privacy Policy</span><br>
<br>
Appventure Studio reserves the right to amend, modify or update this Privacy Policy at any time for any reason and without notice, and your continued use of the Service after such changes signifies your acceptance of such changes.
